This applicaiton was written as a tool for Traveller GMs to have system data, with decriptions, at their fingertips and was driven by my need while running the Pirats of Drinax campaign published by Mongoose Publishing and available free at their site. 

All data included with this application has been collected from freely available sources and if copyrighted by Far Future Enterprises or Mongoose Publishing. 

The basic system data was imported from TravellerMap.com and is part of the T5 Second Survey, copyrighted by Far Future Enterprises and others as detailed on TravellerMap.com (http://travellermap.com/doc/credits)
Any information provided in the "Notes" section and the Subsector Library Information is Copyrighted by Mongoose Publishing.
